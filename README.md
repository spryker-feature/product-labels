# Spryker Feature: Product Labels

Highlight specific products in your shop. Customize the look and text of the Labels as they appear in the shop. Any association can be a Label, such as ""Sale"" or ""Christmas"". Products that are new in your shop can automatically be marked with the Dynamic Product Label ""New"" for a pre-defined time range. You can add validity dates to labels, sort them by importance or relevance and allow your customers to filter and search for them in your shop."
